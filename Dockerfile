# The following line fixes the issue, so that project images can once again
# use remotes::install_gitlab to install city of edmonton packages.
# We have put it in the base image in order to make things simple, however we 
# should keep an eye out for a fix to this issue, and remove this line when that 
# happens.
# Note, this could be called in the same RUN command as install_gitlab, and then
# sed -i "$d" /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf  could be used to "undo" it, but we decided 
# against this approach because this would mean the fix is distributed across
# many projects.
# Note that this fix actually gives us the same security setup as we had on 
# earlier (0.3.*) images.
